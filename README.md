# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Listening Behavior Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This project is a case study I worked on to explore Spotify user listening patterns through an interactive Power BI dashboard. It was inspired by a video tutorial, but I took it further by documenting every page and building it with a focus on storytelling and insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This dashboard explores key behavioral trends in how users listen to albums, artists, and tracks on Spotify. The visuals are designed to not just show data, but answer important questions such as:

- How have listening patterns evolved over the years?  
- Are weekends or weekdays more popular for music?  
- Which albums, artists, and tracks are most played?  
- What are the peak listening hours?  
- How does current year activity compare to the previous year?
